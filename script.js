// till 38:00 git 


// now there is one problem that 
// if we are working as a team in a project 

//  then my code is present at my system 
// how to share it with the member of my team 


/// write the code push it to google drive
// he will download it from here 

// {code1}->{code2}->{code3}
// now we have to assign two subtasks to members 
// one login and one payment 
// here branching comes and then we will merge that 
// code


// but how to share with other members

// so there should be a central thing where they 
// both have there code 
// github provide that central thing 


// example 

// basic code of the website is in the github 
// two subtasks are given login and payment 

// now in my system i am doing work on payment 
// now i will push the payment one on github

// now my friend is working on the login one 
// and then he pushes on the github 

// company watches the commit for the 
// promotion and layoffs 

// git remote add origin https://github.com/jayramdangi/temporary.git

// git push -u origin push 
// it is for the first time 
// after that right git push only
